# Node.js README Generator

## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to create an application that uses responses from the CLI and inputs them into a README file using template literals. This assignment also uses static badges that align with a particular license choice, which are generated using shields.io. Module exports and imports are also used to dynamically create a README file within it's own output directory. The node: fs module is used in order to create aforementioned directory and file, as well as inquirer to create a prompt module that allows users to interact with this application via the CLI.
